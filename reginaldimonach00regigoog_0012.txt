superior, the Prior ns Durham. Among the Monks os
Durham, Reginald was, at the rime our Author flourish-
ed, a noi uncommon name; but it is probably os himself
he speaks in p. 167, ‘¹ unus—Regiualdus nornine.” Xe-
nophon and Caesar had sethim the example. Of his
period there can be nofioubt, as he speaks (p. 180) of
an event which happened in the year 1165, ¹¹ nostris die-
bus,” and gives other dates down tu the year> 1172 (p.
254), and as the “ Libellus¹¹ is dedicated to St. Ethelred,
the celebrated Abbot os Rievaulx, who was then advanc-
ed in years (p. 7), and whose lise is known to have ex-
tended into the latter half of the twelsth century.

It was chiefly at the suggestion, and partly by the as-
sistance, of the Ahbnt os Rievaulx that the present collec-
tion was made. “ In hujus damen studii operam,
Dominus Etheldredus Abbas Rievallensis nostri timo-
ris roboravit audaciam ; qui saepius nonnulla miracula
nobis Beatum Cuthbertum magnificando retulit”—“ mi-

ffacula, igitur, quae de ipsius ure didicimus, ipsius auten-
tica sanctitate esse veridica non diffidimus,” p. 4 and 32.
Reginuld, at p. 7, intimates that the whole compilation
was submitted to the Abbot sor his correction ; and these
circumstances may serve to explain the title uf the York
copy os the book—“ Libellus de miraculis S. Cuthberti
secundum Reginaldum de Coldingham—Incipit proemi-
um in subsequentem libellum de virtutibus et miraculis
gloriosi Puntificis Cuthberfi, secundum Etheldredum
venerabilem Abbatern Rievallensis Ecclesiae et Reginal-
dum monachum de Culdingham, directum Priori et Con-
ventui Ecclesiae Dunelmensisss‘ The title which we have
prefixed to nur volume is afforded by the manuscript
